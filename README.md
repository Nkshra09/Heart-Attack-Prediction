# ❤️ Hridaya – Heart Attack Prediction System

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart attack risk based on user health metrics. Designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals 
in early risk assessment and preventive care.

# 🧠 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. *Hridaya* leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and provide predictive insights into heart attack risk. 
The system is built with Python and Flask for backend logic and uses a clean HTML5/CSS3 interface for user interaction.

#🧰 Tech Stack
